During my sophomore year of college (Fall '18 - Spring '19), I worked as a web developer at the Manhattan based digital marketing agency, VisualMax. There, I developed several interactive HTML5/JavaScript/CSS banner ads for one of our clients, Valisure. 

This repository holds the source code for some of the advertisements, as well as the code for a webpage I developed to display the ads to the client. 

The source code for these advertisements is included in the Banner Ads directory.
